# Classification App 

#### In the project,I have created an interactive classification app using Streamlit that covers three popular datasets: 
### ➡️ The Breast Cancer dataset,

### ➡️ The Wine dataset,

### ➡️ The Iris dataset.

#### The Breast Cancer dataset contains information about breast cancer patients and is useful for predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The Wine dataset contains information about three different types of wine from a single region in Italy, and the Iris dataset contains information about three different species of the Iris flower. All of these datasets are commonly used in machine learning research and are useful for evaluating the performance of different classification algorithms.

#### In my classification app,I have used Streamlit to create a user interface that allows users to select the dataset they want to work with, choose a classification algorithm, and see the results of the classification. The classification algorithms I have used include MultinomialNB , random forests, support vector machines, and KNN . These algorithms work by using mathematical models to identify patterns in the data and make predictions about the target variable.

#### Streamlit provides a great way to showcase my machine learning projects and share them with others. With its simple syntax and intuitive interface, Streamlit allows me to quickly build user interfaces for my machine learning models, data visualizations, and other data science projects. My Streamlit app provides a useful tool for exploring and analyzing these datasets, as well as for evaluating the performance of different classification algorithms.

#### Overall, My project demonstrates the power and flexibility of machine learning algorithms and the usefulness of Streamlit for building data science and machine learning applications. By combining these two technologies, you have created an interactive and engaging app that allows users to explore and understand these important datasets.
